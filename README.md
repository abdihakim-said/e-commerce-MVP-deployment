## üõ†Ô∏è Role: Cloud Engineer | DevOps Implementation | Real-World Scenario

### üß© Problem Statement
Many startups or small businesses need to launch e-commerce platforms quickly to validate their idea or reach the market early‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääbut without sacrificing scalability, maintainability, and automation.  
Manual deployment is time-consuming, error-prone, and not repeatable.  

**Challenge:**  
How can we deploy a fully functional Magento-based e-commerce platform on AWS in under 2 hours, using Infrastructure as Code (IaC)?

---

## ‚úÖ Solution Overview

This project demonstrates how to deploy a Minimum Viable Product (MVP) of an e-commerce website in an automated, scalable, and production-ready way using:

- **Terraform** for infrastructure provisioning  
- **Ansible** for configuration management and software installation  
- **Magento** (open-source e-commerce platform)  
- **PHP**, **MySQL**, and **Redis** for the backend stack  
- **AWS EC2** for compute resources  

By leveraging **Infrastructure as Code (IaC)**, the solution is fast to deploy, reusable, scalable, and easy to maintain.

## üèóÔ∏è Step-by-Step Implementation

### Part 1: Infrastructure Provisioning with Terraform

1. **Environment Setup**  
   - Launched the project on AWS CloudShell  
   - Installed Terraform using Amazon Linux commands  

2. **Project Initialization**  
   ```bash
   mkdir ecommerce-mvp && cd ecommerce-mvp
   git clone https://github.com/abdihakim-said/e-commerce-MVP-deployment
   cd terraform
   ```

3. **Configure Terraform Variables**  
   Updated `main.tf` to use:  
   - Default VPC  
   - Key pair: `ssh-aws-bootcamp`  
   - EC2 instance type: `t3a.large`  

4. **Run Terraform Commands**  
   ```bash
   terraform init
   terraform plan
   terraform apply
   ```
   This spun up an EC2 instance with the desired specifications, recording infrastructure state in `terraform.tfstate`.

---

### Part 2: Server Configuration with Ansible

1. **Connect to EC2 Instance**  
   ```bash
   ssh -i ssh-aws-bootcamp.pem ec2-user@<EC2_PUBLIC_IP>
   ```

2. **Install Ansible**  
   ```bash
   sudo yum-config-manager --enable epel
   sudo yum install ansible -y
   ```

3. **Download and Configure Ansible Playbooks**  
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/abdihakim-said/e-commerce-MVP-deployment
   cd ansible-magento
   vi group_vars/all.yml
   ```
   Updated `group_vars/all.yml` with:  
   - Magento public/private keys  
   - EC2 public IP as domain and hostname  

4. **Run the Ansible Playbook**  
   ```bash
   ansible-playbook -i hosts.yml ansible-magento2.yml -k -vvv --become
   ```
   This handled:  
   - LAMP/LEMP stack installation  
   - Magento installation  
   - PHP, MySQL, Redis configuration  
   - File permissions, user creation, services

## üåê Outcome

‚úÖ Successfully deployed a fully working e-commerce MVP using Magento in less than 2 hours.  
‚úÖ Automated both infrastructure and software deployment‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääno manual steps beyond IP configuration and Ansible variable changes.  
‚úÖ Demonstrated how DevOps practices (IaC, configuration management, automation) can deliver fast, reliable deployments‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääideal for startups and lean teams.

## üìâ Challenges Faced

- **Magento Dependency Management:** Required Magento marketplace access keys (API keys) for package installation, which had to be securely managed in Ansible.  
- **PHP Version Compatibility:** Magento is sensitive to PHP versions. Ensuring the correct version was installed required extra attention.  
- **Redis Integration:** Tuning Redis for Magento's full-page caching required playbook adjustments.  
- **Public IP Changes:** EC2 public IP changes on every restart; unless using Elastic IP, manual updates are needed in Ansible variables.  
- **Cache Issues:** Magento's aggressive caching required manual flushing to reflect UI changes.  

---

## üí° Lessons Learned

- Speed and repeatability are crucial in MVP scenarios‚Ää‚Äî‚ÄäTerraform and Ansible are powerful allies.  
- Using IaC from day one saves time and avoids configuration drift.  
- Testing locally or in staging helps iron out environmental and dependency issues.  
- Documentation and modularization of Ansible roles make the stack more maintainable.

```bash
cd terraform
terraform destroy
```
